# Limits and Scope of Windows Missing Recovery Module

## Overview

The Windows Missing Recovery module is designed to backup, restore, and manage Windows environment configurations, settings, and development environments. This document outlines the current capabilities, limitations, and scope of the system.

## Cloud Provider Support

### Supported Cloud Providers
- **OneDrive**: Full support with automatic path detection
- **OneDrive for Business**: Full support with automatic path detection
- **Google Drive**: Supported (manual path configuration)
- **Dropbox**: Supported (manual path configuration)
- **Custom Cloud Storage**: Any cloud storage with local sync folder support

### Cloud Provider Assumptions
- Cloud storage is already installed and configured on the system
- Sync folders are accessible from Windows file system
- Sufficient cloud storage space for backup data (typically 1-5 GB)

## What IS Backed Up and Managed

### System Configuration
- Windows Terminal settings and profiles
- File Explorer preferences and settings
- Start Menu layout and taskbar configuration
- Default application associations
- Power management settings
- Display and hardware configurations
- Network profiles and WiFi settings
- Remote Desktop settings
- VPN configurations

### Development Environment
- **WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)**:
  - Package lists (APT, NPM, PIP, Snap, Flatpak)
  - Configuration files (wsl.conf, fstab, hosts, environment)
  - User shell configurations (.bashrc, .profile, .zshrc)
  - SSH keys and Git configuration
  - Development tool configurations (.vimrc, .tmux.conf)
  - Selective home directory backup
  - WSL distribution information

- **Dotfile Management**:
  - chezmoi configuration and source directory
  - Managed dotfiles with version control
  - Template support and encrypted secrets
  - Cross-machine synchronization

- **PowerShell Environment**:
  - PowerShell profiles and modules
  - Custom functions and aliases
  - Module configurations

### Applications and Tools
- **Gaming Platforms**:
  - Steam game settings and configurations
  - Epic Games Launcher settings
  - GOG Galaxy configurations
  - EA App/Origin settings

- **Productivity Software**:
  - Microsoft Office settings (Word, Excel, Outlook, OneNote, Visio)
  - Browser bookmarks and settings
  - KeePassXC password manager configuration

- **Package Managers**:
  - Chocolatey package lists and configurations
  - Scoop package lists and configurations
  - Winget package lists
  - Windows Store app lists
  - PowerShell module lists

### Security and Authentication
- SSH key configurations (with proper permissions)
- Application-specific authentication settings
- Password manager configurations (KeePassXC)

## What is NOT Backed Up

### System Files and Binaries
- Windows system files and registry hives
- Program Files and installed application binaries
- System32 directory and core Windows components
- Device drivers and hardware-specific files
- System restore points and shadow copies

### Security-Sensitive Data
- Windows credentials and stored passwords
- BitLocker keys and encryption certificates
- EFS (Encrypted File System) certificates
- Windows Hello biometric data
- TPM-stored security keys

### Large User Data
- Documents, Pictures, Downloads folders (assumed to be synced by cloud storage)
- Media files and large personal data
- Email files (PST/OST files)
- Virtual machine files
- Large development repositories (excluded by design)

### Hardware-Specific Configurations
- Device drivers (hardware-dependent)
- Printer drivers and configurations
- Hardware-specific calibrations
- BIOS/UEFI settings

### Temporary and Cache Data
- Application caches and temporary files
- Browser cache and temporary internet files
- System temporary files
- Log files (excluded by design)

## Limitations and Considerations

### Administrative Requirements
- Setup operations require administrator privileges
- Some backup operations may require elevated permissions
- WSL operations may require sudo access within Linux distributions

### Platform Dependencies
- **Windows 10/11**: Required for full functionality
- **PowerShell 5.1+**: Required for module operation
- **WSL 1/2**: Required for WSL-related features
- **.NET Framework**: Required for some operations

### Network Dependencies
- Internet connection required for:
  - Package manager operations
  - Cloud storage synchronization
  - chezmoi git repository operations
  - Font downloads and installations

### Storage Requirements
- Local storage for temporary operations
- Cloud storage space for backup data
- WSL distributions require additional disk space

### Intune and Enterprise Policy Conflicts
- May conflict with Microsoft Intune policies
- Enterprise group policies may override some settings
- Some configurations may be managed by domain policies
- Administrative restrictions may limit functionality

### Gaming Platform Limitations
- Game files themselves are not backed up (only settings)
- Game installations must be managed by respective platforms
- Save games may be handled by platform-specific cloud saves
- DRM and licensing restrictions apply

### WSL-Specific Limitations
- Requires WSL to be installed and configured
- Linux distribution must be accessible
- Some operations require internet connectivity within WSL
- File permissions may need adjustment after restore

## Scope and Design Philosophy

### What This Module Does
- **Configuration Management**: Backs up and restores system and application configurations
- **Environment Setup**: Automates setup of development and productivity environments
- **Cross-Machine Consistency**: Ensures consistent environments across multiple machines
- **Selective Backup**: Focuses on configurations rather than data or binaries
- **Modular Design**: Allows selective backup/restore of specific components

### What This Module Does NOT Do
- **Full System Backup**: Not a replacement for complete system imaging
- **Data Backup**: Does not backup user documents or media files
- **Security Backup**: Does not backup security credentials or certificates
- **Hardware Migration**: Does not handle hardware-specific configurations
- **Enterprise Management**: Not designed for enterprise-wide deployment

## Recommended Complementary Solutions

### For Complete Protection
- **System Imaging**: Use Windows Backup, Acronis, or similar for full system backup
- **Data Backup**: Use OneDrive, Google Drive, or dedicated backup solutions for user data
- **Security Backup**: Use enterprise security solutions for credential management
- **Enterprise Management**: Use Intune, SCCM, or similar for enterprise deployment

### Best Practices
- Use this module alongside, not instead of, comprehensive backup solutions
- Regularly test restore procedures on clean systems
- Maintain separate backups of critical data and security credentials
- Document any custom configurations not covered by the module

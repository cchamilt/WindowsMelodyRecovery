## [Unreleased] - 2025-07-05

### Added
- **Task 2.3 COMPLETED**: Template optimization and splitting of oversized components:
  - **Windows Features Template Split**: Split massive 644-line template into 3 focused templates:
    - `windows-optional-features.yaml` - 161 lines, 6.6KB (Windows Optional Features)
    - `windows-capabilities.yaml` - 241 lines, 10.3KB (Windows Capabilities & Server Features)
    - `windows-updates.yaml` - 232 lines, 9.1KB (Windows Updates & Store Apps)
  - **RDP Template Split**: Split large 605-line template into 2 logical templates:

  - **Impact**: Reduced oversized templates (>500 lines) from 5 to 3 templates
  - **Maintainability**: All split templates are under 350 lines for improved maintainability
  - **User Experience**: Logical separation allows users to backup/restore specific functionality
  - **Organization**: Preserved all original functionality while improving template organization

### Fixed
- **Task 2.2 COMPLETED**: Complete elimination of all JSON parsing and FileConfig validation errors:

    - Added graceful handling of null parse_script results with empty array fallbacks
    - Enhanced JSON validation with recovery mechanisms
    - Improved error messages with application-specific context
  - **FileState.ps1 YAML Parser Compatibility Fix**: Fixed FileConfig validation to handle YAML parser object structures:
    - **Root Cause**: YAML parser creates objects that don't use PSObject.Properties structure expected by validation
    - **Solution**: Enhanced `Test-WmrFileConfig` to access properties directly instead of through PSObject.Properties
    - **Impact**: Eliminated all "FileConfig is missing required property" warnings (hundreds → 0)
  - **Template-Specific Fixes**: Fixed incorrect parameter usage in parse_scripts:
    - **Touchpad Template**: Fixed 3 parse_scripts using `$State` instead of `param($DiscoveryOutput)`
    - **Touchscreen Template**: Fixed 3 parse_scripts using `$State` instead of `param($DiscoveryOutput)`
    - **Visio Template**: Fixed 3 parse_scripts using `$State` instead of `param($DiscoveryOutput)`

  - **Impact**: 97 applications now successfully captured across all templates without any validation failures

### Technical Details
- **Error Handling Strategy**: Replaced fatal exceptions with graceful degradation
- **Null Safety**: Enhanced null checking throughout parse_script execution pipeline
- **JSON Validation**: Robust JSON validation with fallback to empty arrays on failure

  - **Non-Elevated Mode**: Targeted service enumeration using known service names
  - **Result**: Eliminated all "PermissionDenied" warnings while maintaining service discovery functionality

### Warning Analysis Summary

- **Registry Path Not Found (174)**: Expected when software isn't installed (Firefox, Office, etc.)
- **Source Path Not Found (106)**: Expected when applications aren't installed (Chrome, Edge, etc.)
- **JSON Depth Limit (7)**: Complex data structures truncated at depth 5 (acceptable for backup)
- **Privilege Required (5)**: Expected when running non-elevated (DISM, Windows features)
- **Prerequisite Missing (2)**: Expected warnings for missing software (Visio, etc.)
- **State Retrieval Failed (2)**: Network access restrictions (acceptable)

#### Technical Pattern Established
All fixes follow consistent pattern:
```powershell
param($DiscoveryOutput)
$applications = @()

# Handle empty or null discovery output
if ($DiscoveryOutput -ne $null) {
    # Ensure it's an array or validate hashtable
    if ($DiscoveryOutput -isnot [array]) {
        $DiscoveryOutput = @($DiscoveryOutput)
    }

    if ($DiscoveryOutput.Count -gt 0) {
        foreach ($item in $DiscoveryOutput) {
            if ($item -and $item.RequiredProperty) {
                $applications += @{
                    Name = "Type-$($item.RequiredProperty -replace '[^a-zA-Z0-9]', '')"
                    Version = "Description"
                    Property1 = if ($item.Property1) { $item.Property1 } else { "Unknown" }
                    # ... other properties with null-safe access
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

return $applications
```

  - Create procedural recovery documentation
  - Add troubleshooting guides
  - Status: Basic docs exist, comprehensive workflow docs needed

### Gallery Preparation
- **[PENDING]** Clean up verb practices and naming for gallery release
  - Audit all functions for PowerShell approved verbs
  - Standardize naming conventions
  - Prepare for PowerShell Gallery publication
  - Status: Core functions exist, need verb compliance audit

## Phase 5: Advanced Storage & Backup (Lower Priority)

### Data Protection
- **[PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED]** Certificate storage options (keyvault, local file encryption)
  - Status: AES-256 encryption utilities implemented
  - Enhancement: Add Azure Key Vault integration

- **[PENDING]** Store Windows key information (account attached, actual key)
  - Implement secure Windows license key storage
  - Add account association tracking
  - Create key recovery procedures
  - Status: Not implemented, needs security design

### Backup Strategies
- **[PENDING]** User directory sync (filtered/limited rsync to zip/cloud)
  - Implement selective user directory backup
  - Add cloud storage integration beyond current providers
  - Create incremental sync capabilities
  - Status: Cloud providers integrated, user directory sync needed

- **[PENDING]** Recovery policy (90 days weekly backups, cloud/git storage with deltas)
  - Implement retention policy management
  - Add delta backup capabilities
  - Create automated cleanup procedures
  - Status: Basic backup exists, retention policy needed

- **[PENDING]** Network drive backup and Azure Blob storage support
  - Extend beyond current cloud file services
  - Add network drive integration
  - Implement Azure Blob storage provider
  - Status: File-based cloud providers exist, network/blob storage needed

## Phase 6: Enterprise & Advanced Features (Future)

### Server Features
- **[PENDING]** Server features (services, server features, IIS configuration, files/directories)
  - Add Windows Server role and feature backup/restore
  - Implement IIS configuration management
  - Create service configuration backup
  - Status: Client-focused currently, server features needed

### Administrative Management

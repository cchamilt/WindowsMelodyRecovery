# Windows Melody Recovery - Comprehensive Testing Plan

This document outlines a structured approach to resolving all testing issues, improving test infrastructure, and implementing comprehensive test coverage for the Windows Melody Recovery module.

## 🚨 Critical Issues (Priority 1)

### Test Suite Failures - IMMEDIATE ATTENTION REQUIRED

**Status**: ❌ BROKEN - Multiple test suites failing with critical issues

#### Installation Tests
- **Issue**: Infinite loop causing tests to hang indefinitely
- **Impact**: Blocks "All" test suite execution
- **Root Cause**: Likely module loading recursion in `Import-PrivateScripts`
- **Priority**: CRITICAL

#### WSL Tests  
- **Issue**: 0% success rate with repetitive script loading messages
- **Impact**: All WSL functionality untested
- **Root Cause**: Container communication issues and script loading loops
- **Priority**: CRITICAL

#### Restore Tests
- **Issue**: Tests complete but all fail (0% success rate)
- **Impact**: No validation that restore operations work
- **Root Cause**: Template-based restore logic incomplete
- **Priority**: HIGH
